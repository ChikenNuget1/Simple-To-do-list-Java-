# Simple-To-do-list-Java-

Back to Java after taking a long~~~ break.
I was mainly working with Python in the break due to school but I wanted to challenge myself so I decided to work with Java for today.
Java is definitely a more fun coding language than Python.

I definitely want to use more Java in the future.
I probably made a lot of "rookie" mistakes with this code because I'm still not used to the styling of Java and the syntax yet. However I do want to become proficient at this language.
My current goals are:
  - Learn Java
  - Learn C++
  - Strengthen my HTML knowledge
Hopefully I can achieve these goals.
